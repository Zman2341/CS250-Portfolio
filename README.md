# CS250-Portfolio

This is my final project for CS 250 (where I applied Agile and Scrum practices in a software development lifecycle). In this project, I worked with user stories to better understand what users need and used that to build features that address those needs. Writing user stories really helped break down complex requirements into simple tasks that I could code effectively. When developing programs, I like to follow Agile methods like working in short sprints, holding regular check-ins with the team, and reviewing progress often. These approaches keep the team organized and flexible so we can respond to changes quickly. Being a good team member means communicating clearly, being dependable, sharing ideas openly, and helping others when needed. Overall, this project taught me a lot about how to collaborate and manage work as a team while building software that fits user needs. The Sprint Review and Retrospective document included in this repo shows what our team accomplished and what we learned along the way.
